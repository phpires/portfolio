                <p>This is my portfolio</p>
                <p>The intent of this website is to show off my experience as a programmer.</p>
                <p>Isn't it what portfolios are all about?</p>
                <p>No?</p>
                <p>Well, email me explaining what a portfolio is then.</p>
                <p>Anyway I have no personal projects to show off because all my projects are on my company repo :)</p>
                <p>You can check my <a href="https://github.com/phpires">github</a> though, but procceed at your own risk. :x</p>
